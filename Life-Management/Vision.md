Ultimately, the motivation to move forward comes from being aware of the reality. Death and Life.

There will not be a limit on how far I can get, happily.

What I want is to have fun with people and explore the world we live in while I'm here.

My friends say they can't play because of some broken system. If I help, we can start playing sooner...

Helper of Humanity
- Help anyone personally if I have the time
- Help shape the world to make it better

Increase the brain's clock rate

Allow more energy usage
- If I'm tired but not really, increase the energy usage.
- Increase my excitement generally
- Consider the task I'm doing and possible other one I could switch into
- (I should have a good sense of my options/schedule/plan)
- Be excited all the time

Ability to be productive and use Ajarak in any situation
- Social change. Instead of losing my self in social situations, I keep control
- I keep Ajarak on/active and can read/browse/navigate/build
- Problem: How do I remember it?
	- If I use Ajarak while alone, it will eventually transfer to social situations as well

Schedule
- Knowing what to do in different timeframes (roadmap)
- Constantly creating and adjusting the schedule


Life Management
- I'm able to do many things at once without stress
- I know what the value of what I do is

One mode
- My life and thoughts are all connected and it feels like I'm constantly working and living towards the same direction no matter what I think or what I do

When conscious and thinking about my life in general level, feel relaxed and feel the extra energy
- If I think about scheduling an empty time slot, feel that it's not required anywhere particularly
