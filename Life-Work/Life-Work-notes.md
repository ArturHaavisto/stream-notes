(Life-Work is a code name for my life's work)
# What is my Goal:
- Democracy. My goal in life is to help humanity by improving democracy.
	- Why? Because it just bothers me when I see people suffering and I need some goal for my life. I want to do/work.
	- Why democracy? Because even if things went well in the world, only proper democracy would prove to me that the well-being of humanity would continue.
- Utopia. Learn about the world. Take part in coming up with the better, realistic world. Take action towards that goal.
- Helping others to do good. I'm interested of building new ways to communicate and collaborate on internet. Metaverse is the far end of it.
	- Communication: Sharing information through text, images, videos, audio, game, presentation, 3d environment (XR), app interfaces, speech
	- Collaboration: An app/website. Open work through streams that are connected to a community and other people in that community who streams.

I'm 27. It took me a few years to figure out my life and path. I've found a deep inner drive to help humanity. To align this feeling, I've had to commit to extensive self-development. I'm finally at a point where I have a stable personal philosophy as my core source of motivation and the mental resilience to manage negative emotions that previously held me back.

I require very little to be happy. This has made it relatively easy to sacrifice unproductive habits for more useful ones, supporting my lifelong commitment to helping humanity.

My ultimate goal is to see people happy and ensure this happiness is sustained. I believe the only way to achieve this reliably is through a genuine democracy where all people truly hold the power. Therefore, my primary focus is to improve democracy itself, rather than working with individuals directly. The specific policies or decisions people make are less important to me than the assurance that they decided together and were well-informed.

Effective communication is essential for a functioning democracy. Especially with the rise of AI, trust in information on the internet is rapidly declining. Current social communication platforms are often ineffective (mainly because their primary goal is monetization), and I aim to help envision and create superior solutions.

Working alone is inefficient for achieving my goal. This is why I am also highly focused on developing new methods for people to collaborate online. For instance, this could involve creating more transparent ways to view and participate in helping communities through open, connected streaming sessions run by community members. The Metaverse also enables far greater immersion and collaboration potential, and I plan to be on the frontline experimenting with this as the XR field advances.

I am very open to any discussion or suggestions regarding my areas of focus. I am willing to adjust my plans or methods if a better alternative for humanity is presented.

## Youtube
I create live streams on youtube and in time will create videos explaining my ideas and to communicate with similar minded people.

\* means I can forget the task for the day if
I just don't have time that day. No need to
compensate the next day.
\+ means I need to compensate the lost
time in the future.
