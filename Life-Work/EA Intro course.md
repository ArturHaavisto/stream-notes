# What do I want to get out of this program?
- Learn if there is something I don't already know and haven't considered. Maybe that will change my future plans. Also knowing there aren't gaps is valuable.
- Knowledge of this program. How is a new member introduced?
	- A lot of reading. It's mandatory.
	- Small introduction to forum posts
- Networking
- An opportunity to develop myself
	- Focusing and understanding anything
		- Summarizing to test my knowledge (build sharable knowledge). Give a monologue/lecture
	- Expand my vocabulary
		- Ability to understand others and have philosophical conversations
	- Developing my working skills
		- Time management
		- Priority in life

# Week 1
CFAR - Center for Applied Rationality
- I didn't fully grasp their mission
- No examples
- It felt like they just do research themselves in close circle
- The only path is to attend a workshop. High barrier to entry. No example of a workshop.

- Not being able to measure concepts is hard for many?

1. What's the scale?
2. Is the topic neglected?
3. Is it solvable?
Comment: a video was very nice. easy to follow

## Extra
+ The cognitive science of rationality might be an interesting read
	+ https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xLm9mgJRPvmPGpo7Q/the-cognitive-science-of-rationality
+ 
## Question
- What are the future plans to develop the intro program?
- About the principles: Are there more of them or some other versions? What is the history of them?
- (Should I read the chapter 1 and 2 again even if I felt I already grasped the ideas?)

# Week 2
## GiveWell
+ I wanted to see charities that help education, but couldn't find it
## Core readings
### All Animals Are Equal
- There has been different liberation movements for groups of people, why not animals as well?
- If we widen our views/morals, it's logical to include animals to have rights as well?
- Women's rights attempts were compared with animal rights as a parody
- Directly comparing two groups doesn't work with women and men, so many arguments between humans and animals shouldn't have weight as well
- What even is equality?
- Jeremy Bentham: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"
- Is suffer the best consideration of rights?
- Skin color is one of the easiest way to group people.
- In many modern lives, like in cities, people see only meat as food.
### The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle
- Would you rescue a drowning child if it didn't cause any meaningful harm to you?
- Would distance make a difference where we physically wouldn't see the child?
- Even if some of the money get's lost, it will still help someone
- We no longer live just in local reach, but global
- Why shouldn't I donate to charities? Do I need to avoid other feelings anymore?
- Consumerism
### The Moral Imperative toward Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health
- Some solutions do much greater amount of good
## Questions
- How high people that care about animal equality prioritize it compared to first helping people?
- 

# Week 3
## The Future is Vast
- A lot of numbers
- Longtermism
- 


## Questions
- What are the reasons someone would become interested in the long term human vision?
- 


- Have future problems known, but don't make it pushy. I want to know
- Don't just settle for today but use the extra energy to the future.

- 

## Questions

- What is the goal of what I should do differently?
