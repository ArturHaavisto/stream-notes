# Using AI tools
## Tools for creation
- Whole code
- Code completion
- Strengths:
	- Creating unit tests
	- Documentation
- Make ai do a detailed description plan.md
- Snyk Open Source (DeepCode AI Agent)
	- Scans the generated code for vulnerabilities and compliance issues

Replit AI

Krater.ai
- Contains all ais

SC Training
- Create courses/training

### Claude Code
- On terminal using npm
- Todo lists. Shows what it will do and cross them when it does
- Bash commands without leaving to another tab in terminal. Handy.
- Documentation
- Either manual ask/accept or auto when moving from phase to phase
- Screenshots as input (for example error messages)
- Claude.md: programming and project rules it follows
- Message queue
- Plan mode before proper work
- Different "think 'how hard'" options for how long it will think
- Web search feature
- Change tracking, log
- Integration with Github Actions
- Parallel instances running at the same time
	- For bugs for example
	- Use git worktrees 
- Custom commands file for repeating commands
- Subagents: specialized agents for small tasks that Claude controls (like testing)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): access database, or enable claude to "see" browser window, etc

### AI agents
- GitHub Copilot

- Tabnine
	- Most private
	- "Air-gapped"

- Cursor
	- Cursor > Copilot by metrics
		- BYOK (Bring your own key)

- Amazon Q Developer


## Tools for productivity
### Learning
- Notebooklm
	- What is it?
	- What problem does it fix?
	- How could it be better?
- General chatbots for learning

- How do I connect my notes with AI?
	- On pc (using obsidian)
	- Notion?

Studypdf
- Upload the material and study with ai


Search engines
+ Exa

### PC workflow
- Asking about anything in a separate window
	- conversations are saved
	- no difficulties navigating, always goes back to ready to write
		- browser is bad
		- cli best
	- needs to be open at all times
- Ask quick questions where I don't care about the history
	- use separately from separate window
	- also a separate window

- Different windows (+color coded) for different agents

- Excalidraw and Miro AI integration
	- Create diagrams from text notes

#### Automated tools
- Automated engines
	- n8n
	- Zapier
	- Make (formerly Integromat)
	- Pipedream
- Apis
	- What are there?

- GEMINI.md file
### AI assistant
#### On PC
- Having a constant conversation on
#### On phone



# Building AI
- MCP researching

- RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
	- Searches the data from a source
	- Adds the data into the prompt
	- The prompt uses llm with the added data

- Vector Database:
	- Instead of using structured/stiff data like tables, the data is turned into a data that can be queried "smartly"
	- The process of turning a piece of data (like a sentence) into a vector is called **Embedding**.
