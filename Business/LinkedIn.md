- The bio is there to explain about me what I would anyways say.

Hello Friend!

I am someone who has faced the nothingness of this reality and by mastering my thoughts and emotions, I have build myself meaning that aligns with my deepest desires, to help solve the mess of this world where we people keep fighting with each other and avoid facing ourselves.

I want to improve democracy because if it worked, I could trust that people together would work on the problems and I could enjoy more peaceful life. Some of my ideas of what would be needed are: better communication systems and platforms between collaborators, more focus on making education materials and techniques better than just rewriting it over and over again, political systems and communication made easier to understand by people with different levels of political knowledge.

Some interesting technologies and fields are XR and AI. XR represents the potential of visual information flow and experiences and it's already good enough that I use my headset daily to work with large screens with stars and galaxies in the background. AI has the most disruptive potential for getting humanity into a bad or good direction. It keeps helping my work more and more each day and I will bring my contribution on trying to lead it into a good direction.

If I seem in anyway interesting it means you think we have something in common. Let's connect and enrich our lives even by a quick interaction, because who knows what it could lead into...

No matter what position I get or what project I start, I'm always interested to hear opportunities that would let me give a bigger contribution to humanity.
