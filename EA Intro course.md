# What do I want to get out of this program?
- Learn if there is something I don't already know and haven't considered. Maybe that will change my future plans. Also knowing there aren't gaps is valuable.
- Knowledge of this program. How is a new member introduced?
	- A lot of reading. It's mandatory.
- Networking
- An opportunity to develop myself
	- Focusing and understanding anything
		- Summarizing to test my knowledge (build sharable knowledge). Give a monologue/lecture
	- Expand my vocabulary
		- Ability to understand others and have philosophical conversations
	- Developing my working skills
		- Time management
		- Priority in life

# Week 1
CFAR - Center for Applied Rationality
- I didn't fully grasp their mission
- No examples
- It felt like they just do research themselves in close circle
- The only path is to attend a workshop. High barrier to entry. No example of a workshop.

- Not being able to measure concepts is hard for many?

1. What's the scale?
2. Is the topic neglected?
3. Is it solvable?
Comment: a video was very nice. easy to follow
## Question
- What are the future plans to develop the intro program?
- About the principles: Are there more of them or some other versions? What is the history of them?
- (Should I read the chapter 1 and 2 again even if I felt I already grasped the ideas?)
