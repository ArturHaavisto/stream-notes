# Verbal
- Think of a word/concept. Then, start talking about it and don't stop. Move from thought to thought. The aim is to improvise and not lose flow.

# Non-verbal
## Eye contact
- For my whole life, I've avoided eye contact
- Reason: I can't think and focus with my eyes at the same time, at least well.
- When I talk, I become blind.
- It's not only about eye contact, but also not changing the focus point
- I don't remember seeing expressions, what clothes people wore, etc.
- Shows confidence
