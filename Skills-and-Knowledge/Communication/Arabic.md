### Island 1: The Introduction (Meeting someone for the first time)

أهلاً وسهلاً، تشرّفنا
- _Welcome / Hello, we are honored (by this meeting)._
- **Use Case:** This is the most common way to respond when someone introduces themselves. Even though it is plural ("We"), it is used by individuals to show politeness and warmth.
### Island 2: The Natural Exit (For someone you know or just met)

You asked if you should thank them every time. In Arabic culture, gratitude is deeply embedded in speech, but you don't always use "Thank you" (**شكراً**). Instead, you use "Prayers" or "Well-wishes."

يعطيك العافية
- _May (God) give you health/vitality._
- **Use Case:** This is the "Swiss Army Knife" of Arabic exits. You say it to a shopkeeper, a friend, or a colleague. It acts as both a thank you and a goodbye. It is perfectly natural to say this every single time you see the same person.
فرصة سعيدة
- _A happy opportunity._
- **Use Case:** This is the natural equivalent of "Nice to meet you/Happy to have seen you." You use this at the end of the conversation.
نشوفك على خير
- _See you (let us see you) in good health/on a good note._
- **Use Case:** Use this for people you will see again. It replaces the formal "I was happy to meet you" once a relationship is established.

### Island 3: The Motivation (Simplified)

As requested, here is the simplified version of your motivation using authentic phrasing.

أتعلم العربية لأفهم القرآن والثقافة
- _I am learning Arabic to understand the Quran and the culture._
- **Use Case:** A direct, humble answer to "Why are you learning?"
