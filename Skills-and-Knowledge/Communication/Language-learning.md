Conversational tool:
- Be able to start a conversation without any knowledge of the target language
- Use English and then by conversation, get to know other words.
- Requirements:
	- It needs to detect my voice ok
		- If it doesn't work, it's fine as far as I could create a method where I could just say to ignore it. It needs to understand the problems with microphones
	- I can control the pace of their voice.
	- It can sustain silent breaks. If I don't speak it means I'm thinking and don't want interruptions.

Cases:
- I suddenly want to know what that word is in X language and how to use it in 3 sentences.
	- On PC/On mobile
	- Short explanation and then 3 sentences.
	- 30 seconds
	- Somehow store the word and sentences + translations + AUDIO
	- Example: What is "Table" in Arabic and Chinese?
