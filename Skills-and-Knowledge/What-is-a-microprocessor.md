[What is Microprocessor: Block Diagram, Evolution, Working, Features - javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/microprocessor-introduction)
- IC: Integrated Circuit = microchip or chip, small electronic device made of semiconductor materials
- PCB = printed circuit board
- Microcomputer = a digital computer with one microprocessor
- transistor = controls electrical circuitry (on/off)
- (Bipolar Junction Transistor(BJTs), Field-Effect Transistors(FETs))
- register = Stores data for the CPU (Data, Instructions, Addresses, Control)
- diode = allows current to flow in only one direction
- (Rectification, Switching, Protection, Signal Modulation)
- Instruction Set = The group of commands microprocessor understands
- Bus = Set of conductors intended to transmit data, address or control information
- IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)
- Clock Speed = per second
- Bandwidth = The number of bits processed in a single instruction
- Word Length = The number of bits the processor can process at a time
- Data Types = binary, ASCII, signed and unsigned numbers

# Microprocessor
- Fetch
- Decode
- Execute

## Alu
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations
- Data comes from input device, or memory

## Control Unit
- Controls the instructions and flow of data within the computer

## Register Array
- B, C, D, E, H, L, and accumulator

## Types of Microprocessors

### Vector Proccessors
- Specialized types designed to efficiently perform mathematical and scientific computations on large sets of data using vector operations.
- Have been used in supercomputers and specialized computing systems
- Uses multiple vector pipelines

### Array Processors of SIMD Processors
- Also designed for vector computing.
- Handle arrays or matrices as their primary data structure
- Specialized to execute the same instruction on multiple data elements in parallel.
- Commonly used in GPUs and DSPs(digital signal processors)

### Scalar and Superscalar Processors

### RISC and CISC Processors
- Reduced Instruction Set Computer: Hardware approach
- Complex Instruction Set Computer: Software approach

### Digital Signal Processors (DSP)
- Designed to process signals

### Symbolic Processors
- Designed for expert system, machine intelligence, knowledge based system, pattern-recognition, text retrieval, etc.

### Bit-Slice Processors

### Transputers

### Graphic Processors
