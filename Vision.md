Ultimately, the motivation to move forward comes from being aware of the reality. Death and Life.

There will not be a limit on how far I can get, happily.

What I want is to have fun with people and explore the world we live in while I'm here.

My friends say they can't play because of some broken system. If I help, we can start playing sooner...


What I have
- Ability to go beyond the norms
- Sudo access to the brain

Notes
- There are no risks in changing the brain

The potential
- Ajarak
- Increase the brain's clock rate
- Allow more energy usage

Requirements
- Scalability

Life
- Priority goes to control & development of itself
- Any excess energy goes towards work

Ajarak
- Life Management
- Self-Development
- Work
- One mode
	- Is it really difficult for the brain to hop from one task to another or does it just change the signal/feeling as an excuse to think?

What will happen
- Waiting for the next day
- Wanting to go sleep because of worse performance
- Feeling that I have excess energy
- Feeling I'm on top of my life
- Knowing what I wanted to think about if I had the time, even 10 seconds
- Wanting to use Ajarak to see the bigger picture
- Being happy and excited because I have too many things I want to do
- I'm aware often that I could be more productive and energetic
- Constantly making boring work exciting
- Keep going after every step back
- I will find the balance of the greatest output and value by switching between selected, different type of work
- I'm able to quickly switch between ideas and choose where to focus on
- I know what my target is easily
- I will naturally start doing from planning. Stopping this session is fine.
- I'm able to change the speed of my thoughts

- What will my life look like from now on?
	- When I wake up
	- During the day
	- During the evening

The vision:
- Helper of Humanity
	- Help anyone personally if I have the time
	- Help shape the world to become better
- People
- Projects
- Navigating the reality
- Ajarak

Stream
- Can I take a pause and just not do anything?
- What if I lose all the videos?
- Should I do way more of these streams?
- Can I do stuff on stream that I can't show?
	- What If I do something for 2 hours that I can't show?
- I can always wait for someone to come and reason why I shouldn't do this

- Why do I stream?
	- Document
	- Sharing my thoughts and work
	- A live space where anyone could come and say hi
